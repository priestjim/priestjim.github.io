> **I AM**

a **Distributed Systems Engineer** and **Infrastructure Automation Specialist** currently residing in San Francisco, CA.

> **I OWN**

a double-major'ed **BSc in Computer Engineering and Computer Science** from the Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus in Athens, Greece.

> **I â™¥**

everything UN*X. Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris all have a special place in my heart. I began working with FreeBSD and Linux around the turn of the millennium and Solaris followed shortly after.

I also have a knack for Virtualization, having worked with pretty much every major virtualization solution available in the market including VMWare vSphere, Citrix XenServer, Redhat RHEV/KVM, AWS, OpenStack, OpenVZ and Docker.

Lastly, the last few years I've been working with Chef and its great ecosystem (chef-dk, test-kitchen, serverspec among others) and have contributed to or are actively maintaining a good amount of cookbooks and tools.

> **I SPEAK**

Erlang, Elixir, Ruby, Bash, Lua (and NGINX/Lua), Javascript, Python and Delphi, in order of fluency.

Also Greek, English, French and a little bit of Spanish.

> **I ENJOY**

playing acoustic fingerstyle guitar, listening to diverse genres of music and being a fanatic bookworm (technology, mathematics, astrophysics, religion and philosophy are my main areas of interest).

On my really really spare time, I slide on ice on a [board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnowBoarding) or [skates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey).
