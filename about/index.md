> **I AM**

a **Distributed Systems Engineer** and **Infrastructure Automation Specialist** currently residing in San Francisco, CA.

> **I OWN**

a double major in **BSc in Computer Engineering and Computer Science** from the Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus in Athens, Greece.

> **I â™¥**

everything UN*X. Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris all have a special place in my heart. I began working with FreeBSD and Linux around the turn of the millennium and Solaris followed shortly after.

I also have a knack for Virtualization, having worked with almost every major virtualization/containerization solution available in the market including Kubernetes/Istio, Docker, Google Cloud, AWS, VMWare vSphere, Citrix XenServer, Redhat RHEV/KVM, OpenStack and OpenVZ.

Lastly, I hold 5+ years under my belt of infrastructure automation and assorted ecosystems (Chef, Ansible, chef-dk, test-kitchen, serverspec among others) and have contributed to or are actively maintaining a good amount of cookbooks and tools.

> **I SPEAK**

Erlang (*5+ years*), Elixir (*2+ years*), Javascript/NodeJS (*2+ years*), Go (*1 year*), Bash (*10+ years*), Lua (and NGINX/Lua) (*3+ years*), Python (*2+ years*), Ruby (*4+ years*) and Delphi ??.

Also Greek, English, French and a little bit of Spanish.

> **I ENJOY**

playing acoustic fingerstyle guitar, listening to diverse genres of music and being a fanatic bookworm (technology, mathematics, astrophysics, physics and philosophy are my main areas of interest). Currently, astronomy and astrophotography occupy most of my free time.

On my really really spare time, I slide on ice on a [board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnowBoarding) or [skates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey).
